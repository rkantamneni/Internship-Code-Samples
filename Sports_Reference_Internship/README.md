# Sports Reference Code Sample

## I approached this problem by initially creating an array and using two for loops to insert the json data into the array, and then print it all out. However, I realized it would be simpler to iterate through the teams and print the results as I go because it would make it easier to print team names on the left hand side.

## Improve Code: An area where the array could perhaps help more is I were to analyze two statistis at once. Each data line in the json provided the win record and loss record for a team. I only utilized the win data on each line, but the loss data number could have been used to determine the opposision's win number against the current team being analyzed. This would ultimately lead to less memory references and a slightly quicker runtime.
